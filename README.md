# ZeroSpeech Syllable Discovery

## Development

### General rules:
- Don't push to `master`, use branches.
- Keep branches small and focused.
- Don’t squash other people’s commits.
- Check that your code works before pushing.
- Report any broken code or inaccessible scripts.

### Setup

#### Using poetry

If you plan on making serious changes, such as adding packages or making a new release, then please use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). After it is installed, then `cd` into the cloned repo and run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This should get everything up and running.

#### Using pip

Alternatively, if you are just checking things out, or want to make minor contributions, then you can install the dependencies with pip.

Install build dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install isort black pre-commit ipykernel torchaudio matplotlib tgt
```

Install training dependencies:

```bash
pip install wandb wandb[media]
```

### Code explanation

In `zerosyl.wavlm` you will find the WavLM's original nn.Module with very minor changes.

In `zerosyl.model` you will find two nn.Modules:
1. `class ZeroSylBase(WavLM):`
    - This is a wrapper around `WavLM` that allows you to conveniently perform PromNormSeg on an intermediate layer and then meanpool a later later within those segments.
    - Look at the `ZeroSylBase.segment(wav)` method this is where the core method is applied.
    -  The rest of the methods are helper and convenience methods.
2. `class ZeroSylDiscrete(ZeroSylBase):`
    - This is a wrapper around ZeroSylBase that adds a codebook and performs vector quantization using cosine distances to get cluster IDs for each segment.
    - Look at `ZeroSylDiscrete.tokenize(wav)` for core functionality.

There is also an nn.Module in `train_boosting_model.py`:
- ``class WavLMWithPredictionHead(WavLM):``
    - This one adds a nn.Linear layer at the end to project to the vocab size. This way we can train WavLM to predict the discovered syllable IDs.

### Downloading the checkpoints and data

You should have the following structure inside your workspace:
```
.
├── checkpoints
│   ├── 🔴 WavLM-Large.pt
│   ├── 🔴 km10000-centroids.pt
│   └── 🔴 ZeroSyl-Boost-layer-11-win-3-prom-0_5-steps-1k.pt
└── data
    ├── alignments
    │   └── LibriSpeech
    │       └── 🔴 dev-clean/*
    ├── waveforms
    │   └── LibriSpeech
    │       └── 🟠 dev-clean/*
    ├── 🟢 sample.TextGrid
    └── 🟢 sample.flac
```

So go and download the missing thing from the following sources:

| source | link |
|--------|------|
| 🔴     | https://github.com/nicolvisser/ZeroSyl/releases/tag/v0.1.0 |
| 🟠     | https://www.openslr.org/12 |
| 🟢     | Part of repo. No need to download. |

### Visualizations

There are a few examples scripts to visualize the results:

```bash
python visualizations/view_raw_embeddings.py
python visualizations/view_zerosyl_base_boundaries.py
python visualizations/view_meanpooled_embeddings.py
python visualizations/view_zerosyl_discrete_tokens.py
python visualizations/view_boosted_embeddings_1k_steps.py
python visualizations/view_boosted_embeddings_25k_steps.py
```

You can modify the `STEM` constant in these script if you want to plot different examples from LibriSpeech

You can also play around with `ZeroSylBase`'s hyperparamters by modifying the following attributes right after the model was loaded:

```python
model = ZeroSylBase.from_pretrained_checkpoint(checkpoint_path).cuda()
model.boundary_layer: int = 11  # on which layer to compute norms
model.window_size: int = 3  # for norm smoothing
model.prominence: float = 0.5  # for peak detection
model.meanpool_layer: Optional[int] = None  # which layer to meanpool
```

### Formatting

There is a pre-commit hook that runs the `isort` and `black` formatters.
If your commit fails, just stage the new formatted code and commit again.

If you want to format the code yourself, run:

```bash
poetry run isort .
poery run black .
```

### Poetry releases cheat sheet

1. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
2. Update the version using Poetry
    ```bash
    poetry version patch
    ```
    or `poetry version minor` or `poetry version major`
3. Commit the version bump
    ```bash
    git add pyproject.toml
    git commit -m "Bump version to v$(poetry version -s)"
    ```
4. Create a Git tag
    ```bash
    git tag -a v$(poetry version -s) -m "Release v$(poetry version -s)"
    ```
5. Push the changes and tag to GitHub
6. Create the GitHub Release
    - Go to GitHub → your repo → Releases → “Draft a new release”
    - Then select the tag you created
    - Upload any updated checkpoints + instructions
